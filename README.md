## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AliHadi-RAI/Fake-news-Classification.git
    cd Fake-news-Classification
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare or download your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the main classification script:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder for experiments and visualizations.

## Dataset

You can use publicly available fake news datasets or your own data. Example datasets include:
- [Fake and real news dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- [LIAR dataset](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip)

Place the dataset files in the `data/` directory and update any paths as needed in the scripts.
